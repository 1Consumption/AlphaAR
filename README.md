# ARpopUp
This project is an alphabetical learning application for infants and children.<br>
In short, it is an application that lets infants and toddlers show a corresponding 3D object via tablet when they complete a word with a word card.<br>
This application can create interest in infants and children by combining unique visual and auditory effects instead of boring word learning.


There are only two things to prepare.<br>
The tablet to download the [attached alphabet card](https://github.com/HanseopShin/AlphaAR/blob/master/Alphabet%20Card.zip) and the [attached application](https://github.com/HanseopShin/AlphaAR/blob/master/ARpopUP.apk).
